  abstract = {Latent Growth Curve Models (LGCM) have become a standard technique to model change over time. Prediction and explanation of inter-individual differences in change are major goals in lifespan research. The major determinants of statistical power to detect individual differences in change are the magnitude of true inter-individual differences in linear change (LGCM slope variance), design precision, alpha level, and sample size. Here, we show that design precision can be expressed as the inverse of effective error. Effective error is determined by instrument reliability and the temporal arrangement of measurement occasions. However, it also depends on another central LGCM component, the variance of the latent intercept and its covariance with the latent slope. We derive a new reliability index for LGCM slope variance—effective curve reliability (ECR)—by scaling slope variance against effective error. ECR is interpretable as a standardized effect size index. We demonstrate how effective error, ECR, and statistical power for a likelihood ratio test of zero slope variance formally relate to each other and how they function as indices of statistical power. We also provide a computational approach to derive ECR for arbitrary intercept-slope covariance. With practical use cases, we argue for the complementary utility of the proposed indices of a study's sensitivity to detect slope variance when making a priori longitudinal design decisions or communicating study designs.}

  abstract = {Methodological developments and software implementations are progressing at an increasingly fast pace. The introduction and widespread acceptance of preprint archived reports and open-source software have made state-of-the-art statistical methods readily accessible to researchers. At the same time, researchers are increasingly concerned that their results should be reproducible (i.e., the same analysis should yield the same numeric results at a later time), which is a basic requirement for assessing the results’ replicability (i.e., whether results at a later time support the same conclusions). Although this age of fast-paced methodology greatly facilitates reproducibility and replicability, it also undermines them in ways not often realized by researchers. This article draws researchers’ attention to these threats and proposes guidelines to help minimize their impact. Reproducibility may be influenced by software development and change over time, a problem that is greatly compounded by the rising dependency between software packages. Replicability is affected by rapidly changing standards, researcher degrees of freedom, and possible bugs or errors in code, whether introduced by software developers or empirical researchers implementing an analysis. This article concludes with a list of recommendations to improve the reproducibility and replicability of results.}
