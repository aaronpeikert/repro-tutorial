## How to reproduce this manuscript

To reproduce this project Git, Make, and Docker is required (see [the
installation
guide](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-tutorial/blob/main/install.md)).

Open the terminal, download the repository, and enter the directory:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-tutorial.git
cd repro-tutorial
```

Then build the Docker image, and run Make:

``` bash
make docker &&
make -B DOCKER=TRUE 
```

## Abstract

Computational reproducibility is the ability to obtain identical results
from the *same* data with the *same* computer code. It is a building
block for transparent and cumulative science because it enables other
researchers, on other computers and later in time, to reproduce and thus
understand how results came about while, at the same time, it avoids a
variety of errors that may lead to erroneous reporting of statistical
and computational results. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how the R
package `repro` supports researchers in creating fully computationally
reproducible research projects with a focus on current Open Science
practices; starting from sketching the research proposal, over
preregistering an analysis as executable code with simulated data, until
the creation and dissemination of the final scientific report.
